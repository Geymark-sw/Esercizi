"""9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. 
Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called open_restaurant() 
that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open. Make an instance called restaurant from your class.
Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods."""
